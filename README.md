## RESEARCH-CONTEST-3-2024

This repository keeps track of my preparation for the upcoming **Research Contest** held by my university.

`Start date: January 22 2024`

`PROJECT TRACKER:`

- Jan. 22: 
  - Get stressed learning about LaTeX
  - Set up environment in vscode (Failed)
  - Currently using **Texmaker** and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) instead
  - Learning LaTeX commands
    - [LaTeX â€“ Full Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydOTMQC7np0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) (extremely low-paced)
    - [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) (self-paced)
  - Daily LaTeX practice is preferable to learning all commands at once because there are just too many things
- Jan. 23:
  - Grasp the idea of skeletonization as it is a new concept to me
    - [Skeletonization 101](<papers to research/skeletonization_101.md>)
    - [Skeletonization/Medial Axis Transform](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/skeleton.htm#:~:text=Brief%20Description,of%20the%20original%20foreground%20pixels.)
  - Read [Hi-LASSIE Paper](<papers to research/Yao_Hi-LASSIE_High-Fidelity_Articulated_Shape_and_Skeleton_Discovery_From_Sparse_Image_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf>)
  - [Hi-LASSIE Project Page](https://chhankyao.github.io/hi-lassie/)
  - Learn LaTeX commands
  - Documents for later use:
    - [Distance Transform](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/distance.htm)
    - [Thinning](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/thin.htm)
    - [Binary Images](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/binimage.htm)
    - [Thresholding](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/threshld.htm)
- Jan. 24:
  - Continue reading [Hi-LASSIE Paper](<papers to research/Yao_Hi-LASSIE_High-Fidelity_Articulated_Shape_and_Skeleton_Discovery_From_Sparse_Image_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf>)
  - Analyze and Run/Test Hi-LASSIE Code
  - Successfully using **Zhang-Suen thinning** to extract a [skeleton image from Crack detection's Panicle image](test_img.png)
